                            It's a cellular automata. What does it remind you of?
                            The design goal was to create something reminiscent of both lightning and constellations, and that would produce plenty of hexagons: nature's most futuristic shape.

                            I'm John. My current goal is to become a professional software developer.
                            I graduated from the University of Strathclyde in 2024, achieving a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

                            I have experience developing a variety of software, and, as you can see, that includes web development.

                            I'm particularly passionate about simulations and video games.

                        <h2>About the Site</h2>
                        <p>
                            Personal websites are in vogue this millenium, so I just had to get online.
                            This site's primary purpose is to provide a place to publicise my professional accomplishments,
                            someday.
                            <br>
                            At the moment, you can find examples of my work here, as well as on my GitHub (left).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The site was created in pure HTML/CSS, with no frameworks, but a dash of JavaScript.
