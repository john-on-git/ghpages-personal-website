                                Hi! I'm John, I'm a professional software developer.
                                I graduated from the University of Strathclyde in 2024, achieving a 2:1 Bachelors' in Computer Science.

                                I have experience developing a variety of software, and, as you can see, that includes web development.
                            </p>
                            <p id="email">Email: johngreggwebster@gmail.com</p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="site-technical">
                            <h2>About This Site</h2>
                            <p>
                                Personal websites are in vogue this millenium, so I just had to get online.
                                This site's primary purpose is to provide a place to publicise my professional accomplishments,
                                someday.
                                <br>
                                At the moment, you can find examples of my work here, as well as on my GitHub (left).
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                The site was created with just HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks.
                                The background uses a microservice-based architecture, in order to make it easier to mix-and-match different technologies.
                                This is a portfolio piece, after all, and it's hard to improve by doing the same thing over and over.
                                At the moment, the only service is the API for the <a href="blog.html">blog</a>: C#/Asp.Net, with Entity Framework.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>	
                                The site's design is intended to evoke Y2K revival/webcore vibes, as I'm a huge fan of the artistic and musical scene.
                                Aesthetic cues include skeuomorphism, arcane symbols, and the juxtaposition of organic shapes with clean modernist lines
                                
                                <!--Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to incorporate that last point into a website. <span class="emoji-container"><img src="asset/symbols/sad.png"></span>-->
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                No generative AI was used in the development of this site.
