+ Want to make it w/ ReactJS, backend using Ajax calls to microservices.
+ Plan Steps.
	1. Requirements, User Stories, design mockups.
	2. Static web page mockups.

1. Requirements, User Stories, Design Mockups.
	+ There are two groups in the target audiences:
		1. HR People/Recruiters. These are the most important, I want people to see linked this on my CV & Linkedin, and be impressed.
			+ I'm just taking in the vibe to see if the site looks interesting, impressive, and professional.
			+ I want to find out if John has experience with a particular technology.
			+ I want to see if he has good taste ðŸ’€
		2. Peers. My friends/other coders. I'll definitely end up talking to them about it too.
			+ I want to know what technologies the site used.

	+ Requirements.
		+ Y2K Aesthetic. 
			+ I'm not sure if this fits the tone, but I really dig it.
			+ Some of the website I've seen have been very silly, so it should be fine.
		+ Professional writing tone.
		+ Main page repeating info from CV.
		+ Interactive demonstration of other projects.
		+ Proper security practises ðŸ’€
		
		+ I want some arcane looking sigils. Cellular automata!
		
		+ Timeline?
			+ Achieved HND.
			+ Achieved BSc.
			+ YOU ARE HERE.
		
		+ Cellular Automata.
			+ Grid shape?
				+ Initial doc has squares but the cells are actually cardinal+diagonal lines connecting the corners.
				+ Hexagons are the most futuristic so I should really consider them.
				  I'm not sure how lightningy this would look.
			+ Prototype 1:
				+ Just going to go for a square grid because it's the easiest: it can be implemented in pure HTML,
				  no WebGL canvas shenanigans.
					+ No, apparently this is way slower RIP.
				+ Description:
					+ The grid is 
					+ If there's an empty adjacent cell, fil it
			+ Changed my mind.
				+ Doing triangles was revealed to me in a dream.
				+ Tilt your head and imagine it like parallelograms.
				+ Each cell has 6 neighbors.
				+ Let's try implementing a basic one first, copy game of life and get a basic implementation,
				  before getting weird with some custom transition rules.

		+ Blog.
			+ Alright, set up the backend and the schema. I know what to do for that, barring some minor decisions.
			  Once it's there, I'll think about using it. These things have momentum.
			+ Schema?
				ID :: autoint
				Title :: varchar
				Authors :: varchar
				snippet :: varchar
				
			+ API
				+ GET articles
					+ Params:
						+ offset :: number //skip this many articles
					+ return :: [{id::number, title::string, authors::string, preview::string}]
				+ GET article
					+ Params:
						+ id :: number //id of the article to retrieve
					+ return :: {title::string, authors::string, preview::string}
			+ If I'm gonna do a preview, maybe it should just be the first element.
			+ Since this is gonna be public, I want to lock it down and make sure data is only going out, minimise injection opportunities.
			+ Really need to make sure it's up to best practices on JS injection attacks as well.
			+ Options are... Python Flask/Django, C# Asp.Net, could use Java. I think C# is the move because I don't have any projects with it right now.

		+ virtual garden.
			+ Ok so, I want to have an interactive 3D thing, where you can plant plants and add koi fish to a virtual pond.
			+ How does it actually work mechanically tho.
				+ I want to have a simulated ecosystem, so fish can eat plants or something. Maybe fish aren't the best for that...
			+ Three.js, Godot, seem like they'd help.

		+ CD break
			+ clicking on the cd makes it crack
			+ Click on it 3 times: it shatters and falls off, leaving a depression in the sidebar (persists through refreshes)
			
			+ record scratch, all animation stops
			+ speech bubble from stage left: "HEY! I SAW THAT!"
			+ mascot flies in from stage left. point at disc
			+ "You broke it!" 
			+ finger wag
			+ "Don't worry, I'm sure we have another one..."
			+ flies over to sidebar, opens up a door in the middle and looks in
			+ "..."
			+ begins digging through
			+ "let's see..."
			+ throws out 2-4 random pieces of junk, commenting on each of them
				+ blue eyes white dragon (copyright ðŸ˜¥)
				+ Utah teapot
				+ a platonic solid
				+ other sidebar icons (include some of the unused ideas)
				
			+ pulls out blue ray (different from starting disc)
			+ "Aha! Here we are."
			+ flies back to center screen
			+ "Now, you put it back."
			+ holds it out towards screen. clicking on the disc changes the cursor into a hand holding a CD
			+ clicking on the depression where it used to be inserts it back, restarting site animation
			+ "Byeee!"
			+ flies off stage right
			
			+ what should the character look like?
				+ it needs to have wings
				+ glowing clippy?
DONE
	+ Figure out why the sidebar is slightly longer than the pale sheet and make it not be.
		+ height: fit-content
BUGS
	+ It's possible to error out the blog and put the UI in an invalid state by spamming the buttons to go in and out of an article. 
TODO
	+ cache articles locally to speed up the loading
	+ layout doesn't work well on portrait screens, very long vertical columns look silly
		+ Swap out for an alternative layout with JS?
	+ where should I host images? ohhh why didn't I think of this
	+ mitigate canvas flicker on article load https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15799564/flickering-during-resizing-of-html5-canvas
	+ sidebar/pale-sheet height is still broken: check Galaxy S20 horizontal (ehh kinda)
	+ Make sure it's all accessible, disability compliant.
